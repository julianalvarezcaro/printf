**Extra information**

This repo is the continuation of this repo: https://github.com/julianalvarezcaro/printfViejo

This new repository was created because one of the participants made some commits with different user.name which cause that the old repository have three participant.

The explanation of this is that one of the participants use a vangrant machine for some commits with one user.name and other commits with other vagrant machine that had another user.name the difference can be checked on the old repository user.name: Jiseth user.name: jisethholberton but actually is the same person...
